Write a program that displays the surface area of a cone. Include in your solution the appropriate use of functions.

You must know the radius of the base and the length of the side (slant height, not the height itself). The surface area of the cone is the sum of the
area of the cone and the area of the base.
  Area of cone: pi*radius*side
  Area of base: pi*radius^2

Hence the surface area of a cone is (pi*radius*side) + (pi*radius^2)
